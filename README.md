# My First Phaser Game

This is a very basic game with a sprite that the player can move left, right, up and down using a keyboard's arrow keys. When the player takes their finger off the key, the sprite makes a sound. There are no points or a way to win the game: the purpose of making the program was for me to:
    * create a program that runs in the browser
    * have user interaction - when the user does something, the program reacts
    * use a sound file.


## Installations
    * [PHASER](https://phaser.io/)
    * `npm install http-server -g`

## To run the program:
    * From the terminal, go to the filepath and type `npx http-server`
    * In the browser, open localhost:8080
